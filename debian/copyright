The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
algorithms. The form and manner of this distribution makes it eligible
for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software
Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration
Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.

Gerrit includes an SSH daemon (Apache SSHD), to support authenticated
uploads of changes directly from git push command line clients.

Gerrit includes an SSH client (JSch), to support authenticated
replication of changes to remote systems, such as for automatic
updates of mirror servers, or realtime backups.

For either feature to function, Gerrit requires the Java Cryptography
extensions and/or the Bouncy Castle Crypto API to be installed by the
end-user.
